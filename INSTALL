Building libpandoc on Ubuntu
----------------------------

First install some packages. YMMV - I probably already had a couple of
needed dependencies installed, such as `build-essentials`.

    sudo apt-get install ghc6 haskell-devscripts libghc6-network-dev \
        libghc6-parsec-dev libghc6-mtl-dev

Go to http://haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-latest/ and grab
the latest.

    tar xfz cabal-install-X.X.X.tar.gz
    cd cabal-install-X.X.X
    ./bootstrap.sh

Grab a cup of coffee.

When it's done, you just need to link the `cabal` binary.

    cd
    mkdir -p bin
    cd bin
    ln -s ~/.cabal/bin/cabal cabal

Alternatively, add ~/.cabal/bin to your path.

Use cabal to install the required packages:

    cabal update
    cabal install json
    cabal install pandoc-1.2.1

To enable extra features of Pandoc:

    cabal install pandoc-1.2.1 -fhighlighting -fciteproc

Now compile with:

    ./Setup.lhs configure --user
    make

###Troubleshooting

If you already have a newer version of pandoc, you need to revert back to exactly version `1.2.1`.

Run this command to show which packages/versions are currently installed:

    ghc-pkg list

You can remove a package using this command:

    ghc-pkg unregister package-X.X

If you're having trouble with `make`, try running `make clean` first. You then have to re-run `Setup.lhs`.
